# *Fitting hierarchical models in Template Model Builder*

Course materials for a TMB workshop at the Universidad de Concepción,
January 2018.

Some material was modified with permission from a course by Jim Thorson at
https://github.com/James-Thorson/2016_Spatio-temporal_models. 

Improvements for next time: give a clear example of using factors and
contrasts, e.g., ANCOVA. Also give more examples of dealing with compiler
errors and what the output means. Improve CPUE example from day 4/5 to be
more realistic. More emphasis on writing out hierarchical natural of model
with DAGs.
